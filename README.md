# 🛎️ وصّلنا Wassalna — Customer Support System

**Wassalna** is a full-stack customer support system built with **.NET 8** and **Angular 19** as part of a two-week technical assessment. The system follows clean architecture principles and simulates real-world ticket-based support workflows.

> 💼 This project directly helped me secure a job offer from the company that originally gave the assessment.

## 🚀 Development Journey

This project was originally built in just **2 weeks** as part of a technical assessment. From day one, I followed the **Onion Architecture** and applied the best principles I knew for **Clean Architecture**. That dedication and quality led me to receive an **offer from the company** that gave me the assessment.

Later, I returned to the project with a new goal: not just to *build*, but to **learn deeply**. I spent time studying clean architecture concepts, reading articles, experimenting with patterns, and applying everything I learned into the project. This included:
- Enhancing the **data seeding** process for roles, default admin user, and categories
- Improving the **code structure**
- Training myself on **Git workflows**, including branching, merging, and resolving conflicts

This second phase was less about features and more about **growth** — turning a quick MVP into a more solid, scalable system.
